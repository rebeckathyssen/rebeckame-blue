          Originally working as a radiographer, a poor danish healthcare system
          planted a seed in my mind: If I changed direction in life, could I be
          able to develop something better? A few years later and I am now
          studying to become a data technician specialising in programming, a
          type of education where school is less and learning by doing as a real
          software developer is definitely more. I started my new career at
          Odense Kommune in Denmark in 2019 where I maintain and develop web
          applications for our employees.<br />
          Learning full-stack development I discovered that I have a (huge) soft
          spot in my heart for frontend, and my dream is to be able to create
          good-looking and user friendly applications that'll make a difference
          for the individual.
